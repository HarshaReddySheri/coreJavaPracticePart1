 * OOP -> 4pillar's 
 * you have strong foundation on oop's
 * 
 * If you miss on pillar 
 * it not a strong foundation
 * 
 * Form are decided at runtime -> Override
 * Form are decided at compile time ->OverLoaading
 * 
 * Agenda
 * ******
 * 1.What is Polymorphism?
 * Ans:Polymorphism is the ability of an object to take on many forms
 * 
 * poly -> multiple or morethan one
 * morph-> form
 * 
 * 2.Different types of polymorphism?
 * Ans:
 * 			->Compile-time polymorphism
 * 			->Run-time polymorphism
 * 
 * ->Compile-time polymorphism
 * compile-time polymorphism is a type of polymorphism which can be achieved at java compile-time polymorphism
 * It is also referred as static polymorphism OR early binding
 * complete polymorphism can be ACHIEVED BY METHOD OVERLOADING concept in java
 * 
 * why static polymorphism?
 * we achieved at compile time 
 * it a fixed so it's called mostly static
 * 
 * Why early binding?
 * Polymorphism we achieved fast so it early binding
 * 
 * 
 * ->Run-time polymorphism
 * Run-time polymorphism is a type of polymorphism which can be achieved at java run-time OR execution time
 * it is also referred as dynamic polymorphism OR dynamic method dispatch
 * runtime polymorphism can be ACHIEVED BY METHOD OVERLOADING concept in java
 * 
 * Why dynamic polymorphism?
 * we achieved at runtime
 * change's at runtime is called dynamic 
 * 
 * Why dynamic method dispatch?
 * whatever method we use in polymorphism that are dynamic dispatch by execution engine
 * 
 * 3.Method OverLoading?
 * 
 * 4.Method Overriding?
 * 
 * 5.Is Override annotation mandatory to use in java?
 * 		if mandatory where to use
 * 
 * Ans: Is Override annotation is advisable to use annotation whenever you Override any method
 * 				--> whenever made a mistake the compile is reminding you if you mention @Override
