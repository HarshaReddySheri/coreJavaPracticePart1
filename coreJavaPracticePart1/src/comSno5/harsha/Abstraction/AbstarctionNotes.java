	 * OOP's OR OOP'S principal OR Object Oriented Programming
	 * EX:
	 * java ->object oriented programming
	 * real world object's
	 * *******************
	 * -->mobile phone 
	 * -->car
	 * -->WashingMachine
	 * -->ATM Machine
	 * -->Oven
	 * 
	 * Every Object has their own functionality
	 * -->WashingMachine
	 * 		-->Functionality
	 * 			--> washing & Rinse will provide
	 * -->Oven
	 * 		-->Functionality
	 * 			-->Keep some food and set the time, then it will heat
	 * -->ATM machine
	 * 		-->Functionality
	 * 			-->Money withdrawal, balance enquire, Multiple functionality
	 * 
	 * So when we enter the withdrawal & Background what happen Inside will any say to you
	 * 
	 * --> withdrawal is only providing you as a functionality
	 * --> No one can explain how it working
	 * --> Whenever you press a button what will happen, what the technology
	 * 
	 * --> Implementation is hide & showing Only functionality to user
	 * 
	 * How the real world object showing only functionality & we hiding the implementation for user's
	 * 
	 * Similarly in java
	 * 
	 * why we are hiding implementation?
	 * Ans:if i share or expose ATM machine Implementation
	 * ->then they copy the implementation & providing to world with same copy of ATM machine (COPY RIGHT ON ATM MACHINE0
	 * OR
	 * ->May be you made a twike's(HACKING) in my own ATM MACHINE  
	 * 
	 * EX:
	 * when we expose the functionality then they will use it
	 * that it if you providing or saying implementation to user & it may confusing them
	 * 
	 * ATM machine by using withdrawal button amount will get (money it's simple way) -->functionality
	 * Or
	 * pressing withdrawn button
	 * 		-->server is hit the rest API
	 * 				-->then it will go to bank detail's & it will check the balance & it provide a money
	 * 
	 * AGENDA
	 * ******
	 * 1.What is abstraction?
	 * Ans:Abstraction is a process of hiding the implementation detail's and showing only functionality to the user
	 * 
	 * 2.How can we achieve the abstraction in java?
	 * Ans:Abstraction concept can be achieved with help of interface and abstract class
	 * 
	 * 
	 * How much percentage can we achieved the abstraction in java
	 * 
	 * Interface --> before java 8 using interface can achieve 100%
	 * abstract class (providing partial implementation)--> After java 8 using interface may be may not be achieve 100% it completely depended on the user
	 * 
	 * User providing implementation that we can't achieve 100%
	 * 
	 * Let say abstract method are 10
	 * 		--> Inside that 4 method are implemented
	 * 		-->that mean we loss 40% of abstraction & we gain 60% of abstraction
	 * 
	 * 3.Implementation of abstract?
	 * Ans: At the time of object creation
	 * 
	 * 			--> using INTERFACE name = new CLASS name();
	 * 			can achieve 100% (more abstraction)
	 * 			--> using ABSTRACT CLASS name = new CLASS name();
	 * 			level of abstraction is less 
	 * 
	 * EX: Laptop interface is an example for abstraction
	 * 
	 *
