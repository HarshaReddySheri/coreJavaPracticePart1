 * 
 * 1.What is OOPs?
 * Ans: OOP(Object Oriented Programming) is a programming Paradigm based on the concept of "Objects"
 * 		->Programming Paradigm is an approach to solve problem using programming language
 * 
 * Programming Paradigm:
 * *********************
 * Imperative Programming [How to do]
 * -->Procedural Programming
 * -->Structural Programming
 * -->Object-Oriented Programming
 * 
 * Declarative Programming [What to do]
 * -->Functional Programming
 * -->Logic Programming
 * -->DataBase Programming
 * 
 * 2.What are the Principles Of oops?
 * Ans:1.Inheritance, 2.Encapsulation, 3.Polymorphism, 4.Abstraction
 * 
 * 1.Inheritance   -> code reuseability
 * 2.Encapsulation -> class is example of encapsulation
 * 				   -> Field & Method are encapsulated in One
 * 3.Polymorphism  -> Multiple form
 * 				   -> Same method name but different behaviors 
 * 				   -> Like AparichithuduMovie  
 * 4.Abstraction   -> Hiding data to user
 * 				   -> and showing some part of data
 * 				   -> Like Car [engine, battery are hidden]
 * 
 * 3.Is java Object Oriented (or) Object based programming Language?
 * Ans: -> Inheritance done it's called Object Oriented.
 *  	-> Inheritance can't done it's called Object Based
 * 
 * 4.Is java Pure [100%] Object Oriented programming Language?
 * Ans: No, but in java, 
 *      1.Primitive data type & 
 *      2.static Keyword
 * 		These 2 Things doesn't make pure OOP's in Java
 * 
 * 5.Programming languages that follow OOP?
 * Ans 1.Java, 2.C++, 3.C#, 4.Python,
 * 	   5.Simula -> First OOP Language
 * 	   6.Smalltalk-> First Pure OOP Language
